\f0\fs52 \cf0 Financial Card Services Using Agentic AI on AWS\

\fs26 This comprehensive analysis provides a detailed framework for implementing a multi-agent system leveraging agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities to handle financial card services and knowledge retrieval functions. The architecture employs an orchestrator agent that efficiently routes user requests to specialized agents based on intent recognition and contextual understanding, all built on AWS\'92s robust cloud infrastructure.\
\

\fs44 1. Project Description\

\fs34 1.1 Introduction\

\fs26 The financial services industry requires sophisticated AI solutions that can handle complex, domain-specific tasks while maintaining high levels of accuracy and security. Traditional single-agent chatbots often struggle with multi-faceted requests requiring both transactional capabilities and extensive knowledge retrieval. This project addresses these limitations by implementing a multi-agent architecture that segregates responsibilities between specialized agents, coordinated through an intelligent orchestration layer. The system will handle card services operations (activation, deactivation ) through API integration while providing comprehensive financial knowledge through a dedicated knowledge agent, each with domain-optimized vector databases.\
\

\fs34 1.2 Purpose\

\fs26 This capstone project serves to demonstrate the practical application of cutting-edge multi-agent collaboration techniques for solving real-world financial service challenges. By implementing specialized agents with distinct capabilities, the system will provide more accurate, reliable, and efficient assistance to users seeking financial card services and information. The architecture showcases how distributed AI agents can collaborate to execute complex workflows while maintaining context and delivering coherent responses, significantly improving upon traditional single-agent implementations. Furthermore, this project will demonstrate the effective implementation of agentic RAG techniques to enhance retrieval capabilities across specialized knowledge domains.\
\

\fs34 1.3 Scope\

\fs26 The project will focus on developing three primary components:\
1. A Card Services Agent capable of executing API calls for card activation and deactivation , with appropriate security protocols and verification steps.\
2. A Knowledge Retrieval Agent optimized for accessing and presenting financial information, policies, and procedures related to card services.\
3. An Orchestrator Agent that analyzes user queries, determines intent, and routes requests to the appropriate specialized agent.\
Each agent will leverage its own vector database tailored to its specific domain knowledge requirements. The project will implement the complete end-to-end system on AWS infrastructure, utilizing relevant services for deployment, agent communication, and vector database management.\
